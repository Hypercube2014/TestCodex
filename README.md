# Vehicle Rental Platform

This repository contains a basic skeleton for a vehicle rental platform using PHP 8.3.14.
The project is structured with a public entry point, simple MVC folders, configuration files,
and a SQL schema example.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure PHP 8.3.14 is installed.
2. Clone the repository and run `composer install`.
3. Configure your database connection in `config/config.php`.
4. Point your web server to the `public/` directory.

## Folder Structure

- `public/` – web accessible files.
- `src/` – application source code (Controllers, Models, Views, Services).
- `config/` – configuration settings.
- `database/` – database schema and migrations.
- `tests/` – test bootstrap and future tests.

This is a starting point and does not include a complete implementation.
